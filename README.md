## Usage

```json
{"input":
    {
        "mock_return": "Anything here will be returned as the output of the worker.",
        "mock_delay": 0, // The number of seconds to wait before returning output, raising error or crashing.
        "mock_error": false, // If true, the worker will raise an error.
        "mock_crash": false, // If true, the worker will crash (kills the processes)
        "mock_refresh": false, // If true, the refresh_worker flag is enabled.

        "mock_external": {
            "error_job_return": false, // If true, the job will fail to return the job results.
        }

    }
}
```

### Generator Handler

To test the generator handler override the docker command with the following:

```bash
python3 -u /handler.py --generator
```

To test multiple yeild outputs, set the `mock_return` to a list of values.

```json
{"input":
    {
        "mock_return": ["value1", "value2", "value3"],
        "mock_delay": 0,
        "mock_error": false,
        "mock_crash": false
    }
}
```
