## Usage

```json
{"input":
    {
        "mock_return": "Anything here will be returned as the output of the worker.",
        "mock_delay": 0, // The number of seconds to wait before returning output, raising error or crashing. If generator is enabled, this is the delay between each yeild.
        "mock_progress": {
            "updates": [],  // A list of progress updates to send back to the RunPod API.
            "wait_time": 0 // The number of seconds to wait before sending a progress update.
        },
        "mock_error": false, // If true, the worker will raise an error.
        "mock_crash": false, // If true, the worker will crash (kills the processes)
        "mock_refresh": false, // If true, the refresh_worker flag is enabled.

        "mock_external": {
            "error_job_return": false, // If true, the job will fail to return the job results.
        },
        "mock_logs": [  // A list of log messages to generate, these are sent at the start of the job.
            {
                "level": "info", // The log level to use. Options: debug, info, warn, error
                "message": "This is a log message." // The log message to send.
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Generator or Async Handler

To test the generator handler override the docker command with the following:

```bash
python3 -u /handler.py --generator
```

```bash
python3 -u /handler.py --async_generator
```

To return the stream aggregation include `--return_aggregate_stream` argument.

```json
# To test multiple yeild outputs, set the `mock_return` to a list of values.
{
    "input": {
        "mock_return": ["value1", "value2", "value3"],
        "mock_delay": 0,
        "mock_error": false,
        "mock_crash": false
    }
}
```
